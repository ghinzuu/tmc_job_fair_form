# Requirements

To run the application you will need:
- python3 : https://www.python.org/downloads/
- Flask: pip3 install Flask (on terminal)
- openpyxl : pip3 install openpyxl (on terminal)

# Usage

Open your terminal (look for cmd.exe on Windows and terminal on Mac) and go to the jobFairTMC repository and then run: ´python3 app.py´ to start the server of the app.
Go to a browser and enter http://localhost:5000 to get to the form.
You need a file called jobFair.xlsx at the root of the jobFairTMC repository for the application to work properly.
If you want to record data on a new file, just move or rename the old file and then recreate a new one, calling it 'jobFair.xlsx'
